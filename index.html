        <p>Hi, my name is Olga Repnitsyna. I'm staying home mom and a wife of three the best men in the whole world (two of them are still little monsters for now;)). </p>
        <p class="clear">So this is my full time job to be a personal chef, a housekeeper, a personal driver, an animator and a techer. So i'm thinking it's not enough and i need to try something absolutely new for myself, something that i can create, experiment and see the results right away. So here i am, on my new path - becoming the web-developer after geting my masters degree 16 years ago in management, then being a great watress for 8 years and after for another 8 years being a housewife and a young mom. Just give me 6 month to see how it's gonna go:)))</p>
